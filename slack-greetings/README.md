# slack-greetings

* number analyses (e.g. 0-clean.qmd, etc..)
* use that number if the analysis saves data to the `data/` folder (e.g. data/0-cleaned.csv).
* you might not want to commit your data (if it's too big, or sensitive)
* you can add instructions to the README on how someone could get the data from you.

## What would the end data look like?

It sounds like maybe one row per user, with...

* their username
* a list of tags (e.g. programming languages, topics)
* maybe the original message for sanity checking / validation

## What would we do with it?

Maybe give project leads a sheet, where they could see eg all the python people, or all the front-end web people.

## What other data might we collect?

* Could collect manually people's names (or slack handles), and topics of interest at events (like hack night).
* Could also use the above for attendance counts, etc..
